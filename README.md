## Overview

Welcome to the **ZenBrowser-VerticalTabs-RemoveFootNewTabButton** repository. This project provides a simple solution for users who want to customize their Zen Browser experience by removing the ‘new tab’ button located at the bottom of the vertical tabs. This change can enhance your browsing experience by decluttering your interface.

## Features

- **Custom CSS**: This repository includes CSS code tailored for Zen Browser.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to implement and modify according to your preferences.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on browser performance.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Zen Browser's vertical tab layout.

## Installation

To install the custom CSS, follow these steps:

1. **Download the CSS File**: You can find the latest version of the CSS file [here](https://github.com/infocody8/ZenBrowser-VerticalTabs-RemoveFootNewTabButton/releases). Make sure to download the file to your computer.

2. **Locate Your UserChrome.css**: Open your Zen Browser profile directory. This is usually found in your user folder under `Zen Browser/Profiles/`.

3. **Edit UserChrome.css**: Open or create a file named `userChrome.css` in the profile directory. If it doesn't exist, create a new text file and rename it to `userChrome.css`.

4. **Add the Custom CSS**: Copy the code from the downloaded file and paste it into `userChrome.css`. Save the changes.

5. **Restart Zen Browser**: Close and reopen Zen Browser to see the changes take effect.

## Usage

Once you have installed the custom CSS, the ‘new tab’ button will no longer appear at the bottom of your vertical tabs. This will provide a cleaner look and potentially improve your workflow by reducing distractions.
